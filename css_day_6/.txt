//CSS Overflow
--This makes the whole text visible irrespective of the container size.

--Overflow Scroll
It adds an automatic scroller in the container so for the seeing the content it can be scrolled without affecting the container dimensions.

--Overflow Auto
It is quite similar to scroll but the scroller is only added when the content starts getting out of the container. Mostly this option is used to avoid unnecessary scroll bars if the content already is within the content dimensions.


//CSS POSITION
--CSS Positioning
The CSS positions allow you to precisely control the placement of an element on the web page.

It helps to determine how elements are placed inside the container element and how they interact with the other elements on the page.

--Static(Default)
The elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.

--Relative
Elements are positioned relative to the normal position in the document.

You can use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to move the element from its original position.

--Absolute
Elements are positioned relative to the closest positioned ancestor (parent), which means we need to have a parent element with a positioning other than 'static'.

Note: An absolutely positioned element is removed from the normal flow.

--Fixed
Elements are positioned relative to the viewport (screen) and do not move when the page is scrolled.

This is useful for creating elements like fixed headers or footers.

--Float
The float property is used to shift an element to the left or right within its containing element.

--Sticky
Position sticky is a hybrid between 'relative' and 'fixed'.

It allows an element to become "stuck" to the top or bottom of its container when scrolling, but it behaves like relative positioning within the container until it reaches a specified offset.
