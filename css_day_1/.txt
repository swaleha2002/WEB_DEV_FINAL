//CSS : Cascading Style Sheets

-->The term "cascade" refers to the priority scheme determining which CSS rules are applied when multiple rules target an element. 

-->CSS is used to provide styling to HTML elements, making web pages visually appealing and user-friendly.

-->Key Features of CSS:

-Styles and layouts of web pages.
-Works alongside HTML and XML documents.
-Enables responsive design for different screen sizes.
-Supports interactive effects like hover states and animations.
-CSS is now modularized, with ongoing updates rather than version numbers.
-Allows reusability of the same rules across multiple HTML documents.

//Inline,Internal and External CSS

1)Inline : 
--Inline CSS is used to add custom properties to specific elements.

2)Internal CSS
--Internal CSS is used to apply custom style to the multiple elements on the same page. 

3)External CSS
--instead of adding the styles within the HTML file, we create a separate file with .css extension.
