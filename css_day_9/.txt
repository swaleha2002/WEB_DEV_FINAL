CSS 2D Transform
This property allows the content to be restructured in ways like translate, rotate, scale or skew, etc.

As it is 2D, therefore the content is transformed into x and y dimensions.

Rotate
This property rotates the content of the division either anticlockwise or clockwise acc to the degree of rotation. The values are taken in degree and on adding a negative sign the rotation becomes anticlockwise.

Syntax: transform: rotate(value);
eg :transform: rotate(-10deg);

Scale
This property rescales the width and height of the division in the ratio to the original dimensions. 

For eg: transform: scale(1.4, 1.2);

Skew
This property helps in adding a slant or skew to division. (Skew: A pair of lines neither intersecting nor parallel)

Eg:

transform: skew(10deg, 5deg);

Translate
This property transforms the elementâ€™s position along x or y or both x and y directions.

Syntax: transform: translate(x,y);
