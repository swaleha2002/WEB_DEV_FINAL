CSS Transitions
Transitions control the ease of transformation from one style to another when we hover over that element. Basically, you can control the time take for any transformation to occur.

ex:transition: width 3s;

properties :
    transition-property: transform ;
    transition-duration: 3% ;
    transition-timing-function:ease-in-out;
    transition-delay: 1s;

Short hand :
  transition:all 3s ease-in-out 1s ;
