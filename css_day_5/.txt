//CSS DISPLAY
--if element is inline and in css you set padding then padding top will not be applicable because element is inline.
--then make it inline block.

//display block and display none
--Display Inline
It only takes the space required for content, leaving the rest space for other elements to come. 
Syntax: 
{display: inline;}

--Display Block
It takes the full width available across the website page leaving a new line before and after the element.
Syntax: 
{display: block;}

--display none
display:none removes the element from the document. It does not take up any space

--visibility:
hidden hides the element, but it still takes up space in the layout.


//Shadow and outline

--The Syntax for box-Shadows is as follows:
box-shadow: h-offset v-offset blur spread color inset;

--Syntax of text shadow
text-shadow: h-offset v-offset blur color;

//Outlines
--An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, outside the borders, to make the element "stand out".

--The Syntax for Outlines 
outline: width style color;

//Differences between Outlines and Borders:
While both can visually appear similar, outlines differ from borders in a few ways:

Position: Outlines don't take up space; they're drawn around the element, outside of any border.

Offset: Using the outline-offset property, you can set the space between an outline and the edge or border of an element.

Width: Borders can have varying widths on different sides, outlines have a uniform width.

Rounded Corners: Borders can have rounded corners using border-radius, while outlines generally cannot.
