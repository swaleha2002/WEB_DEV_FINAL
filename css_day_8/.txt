-: CSS FLEX BOX :-
--Flexible Box Layout makes it easier to layout, align and style items in the container while maintaining the responsiveness of the website.

--To create a flexbox you need to set the display of the container as flex

Eg: {display: flex;}


--: Flex Container Properties :--

1. Flex Direction
It defines in which direction the flex elements would be displayed. It takes values like row, column or “reverse” too.

2. Flex Wrap
By using this property we can make our elements responsive for different screen sizes.

3. Justify Content
This property is used to set the position of content or rather align content along the main axis.

4. Align Items
Just like the justify-content property, align-items define the alignment of the flex container but along the cross-axis.

5. Align Content
This property is very similar to align item but here rather than the flex items, the content present in the item is selected for the property.

--: Flex Items Properties :--

1. Order:
As the name suggests, this property sets the order in which the flex items are shown.

2. Flex Grow & Shrink
Decides the relative size of flex items. By default, this property is zero and thus items have the same size.

3. Align Self
This property allows default alignment to be overridden for the individual flex items. Try adding inline CSS to see how this property is used.


--: CSS GRID :--
--it is used to make layouts.

--Just like FlexBox, CSS Grid with the use of rows and columns, make it easier to style website elements.

-- CSS display property allows two grid properties: Grid and Inline Grid. The elements placed in the grid container are called grid items.

Grid Row & Column Property
This is just adjacent to the flex-grow property in Flex Box. It decides how many columns would the selected element be taking in the Grid.

eg:  <div class="grid-item" style="grid-row: 1/5;">2</div>
