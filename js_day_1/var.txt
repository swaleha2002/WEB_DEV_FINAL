What are Variables?
In JavaScript, variables are used to store data. They are an essential part of any programming language, as they allow you to store, retrieve, and manipulate data in your programs.

Data Types
In JavaScript, there are several data types that you can use to store different types of data. Some common data types include:

Numbers (e.g. 10, 3.14)
Strings (e.g. "hello", 'world')
Booleans (e.g. true, false)
Arrays (e.g. [1, 2, 3])
Objects (e.g. { name: "John", age: 30 })

Variable Naming Rules
There are a few rules that you need to follow when naming variables in JavaScript:

Variable names can only contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
Variable names cannot start with a digit.
Variable names are case-sensitive.
It is also a good practice to use descriptive and meaningful names for your variables, as this makes your code easier to read and understand.
