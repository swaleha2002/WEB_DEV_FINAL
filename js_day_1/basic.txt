var vs let vs const

var
The "var" keyword is used to declare variables in JavaScript. It was introduced in the early days of the language and was the only way to declare variables for a long time. However, the "var" keyword has some limitations and has been largely replaced by the "let" and "const" keywords in modern JavaScript.

if (x > 10) {
  let y = 20;
  console.log(y); // 20
}
console.log(y); // ReferenceError: y is not defined


const
The "const" keyword was also introduced in ES6 and is used to declare variables that cannot be reassigned later. "const" variables are also block-scoped and behave similarly to "let" variables in that respect. However, the main difference is that "const" variables must be initialized with a value when they are declared and cannot be reassigned later.

For example: const PI = 3.14;
PI = 3.14159; // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
