//CSS Sizing Unit
1)em- Relative to the font size of the parent element. Eg: 5em means the size would be 5 times the current font size
2)rem- Relative to the font size of the root element.
3)vh-  Relative to 1% of the height of the viewport
4)px-- pixel (1px = 1/96th of 1 in)
Generally we only use pixels to set dimensions of an element.
